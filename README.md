# 201_Final_Project

# Project Description

Our audience includes a wide range of political activists in the United States, particularly readers of The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein. Also the many political activists on the global scale who want to limit ties with the United States or limit global trade. These people probably already have some vague notion of how terrorism can be motivated by foreign policy decisions, diplomatic ties and economic pressure, but we want them to know how more precise details about how these events occur.

For our audience who is unfamiliar with these ideas, we want to illustrate how changes in terrorism can be related to other types of political events.

Questions
* How did terrorism change after the 2003 invasion of Iraq?
* How many terrorist attacks targeted government and other public officials in Chile and other latin American countries during the 1970s? How did the type of weapon change before and after events in the 1970s?(The U.S. funded and trained many of these groups)
* ?


# Technical Description

* HTML page
* .csv file provided by kaggle
* The data has many columns to describe specific situations that are null for most rows, so we will be filtering for these situations when necessary. Some columns store textual descriptions of the events and these strings may be parsed to help filter the rows into new groups.
*
* Many of our questions will be answered by comparing analytics on subgroups to the averages of the outgroups or the data as a whole.
* We anticipate having to read through a lot of the event descriptions before we can figure out an effective way to filter for the events we want. It will also require some effort to do research on political timelines from other sources to correlate events effectively.
