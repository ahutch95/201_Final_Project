This incident was one in a series of 11 luxury home arsons in the Phoenix area between April 2000 and January 2001.  In June 2001, confessed eco-terrorist, Mark Warren Sands was indicted for eight of the arson incidents, pled guilty, and in 2002, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for torching seven luxury homes under construction.  In this particular incident, the victims were Mario and Melanie Lio, whose home was then rebuilt and burned again on October 20 of the same year (102000).",1,1,1,1,2,"Other Crime Type",0,1,0,7,"Facility/Infrastructure Attack",NA,".",NA,".",14,"Private Citizens & Property",76,"House/Apartment/Residence","private luxury residence under construction","private home of Mario and Melanie Lio, which was under construction in the Phoenix mountain preserve area in AZ",217,"United States",NA,".",NA,".","","",NA,".",NA,".",NA,".","","",NA,".","Coalition to Save the Preserves (CSP)","","","","",10056,NA,NA,"","Allegedly in opposition of housing sprawl in the Phoenix Desert Mountain Preserve",1,NA,NA,1,1,1,9,"Other",NA,NA,".",NA,NA,".",NA,8,"Incendiary",18,"Arson/Fire",NA,".",NA,".",NA,".",NA,".",NA,".",NA,".","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,"Unknown",NA,"collectively, all eight arsons caused an estimated $5 million in damages",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",0,NA,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,".",NA,"Sands claimed the home was obstructing his jogging trail, and when the owner of the home stated he would rebuild, Sands wrote a message reading, ""U Build, We Burn Again,"" on a sign at the construction site.

However, during the Federal Grand Jury indictment, prosecutors maintained that Sands committed the acts for his own twisted reasons and the he fabricated letters and claims from the CSP to carry out his plot.  Sands still maintained that he was against development of preserved areas, but also that he ""knew how to sell it,"" ""knew what a god media story was, and ""there was a sense of power"" behind the string of incidents that the media fed on.  The true motives appear to be a combination of personal reasons and to make a broader environmental message, but they remain unknown.  The FBI investigation determined that Sands did in fact fabricate the CSP.  The victims of the incidents were fearful or recurring arsons, and according to sources, Sands still  terrorized the community to portray a broader message.","FBI, ""Terrorism 2000/2001,""FBI, DOJ, 2001.","Foster Klug, ""Arsonist who tried to stop construction sentenced to 18 years,"" Associated Press State & Local Wire, February 11, 2002.","""List of Fires in Federal Indictment,"" Associated Press State & Local Wire, June 15, 2001.","Eco Project 2010",0,0,0,0,""

Officer Wayne Rhatigan, a member of the New York Police Department's mounted division, was alerted by the vendor and then approached the vehicle and looked inside, where he spotted a box that was smoking and was able to smell gunpowder. The NYPD Bomb Squad was called to the scene, where they deployed a robotic device to break the SUV's back windows and to observe what was inside the vehicle. In the vehicle, police discovered the following: three 20-gallon propane canisters; two five-gallon cans of gasoline; 40+ consumer-grade M-88 firecrackers that had been placed inside of a 20-ounce metal container that had been wrapped in duct tape; a 55-inch by 32-inch green metal locker that contained eight plastic bags that held a total of approximately 250 pounds of Urea based fertilizer, a metal pressure cooker pot containing wires and an additional 120 M-88 firecrackers.

Additionally, the vehicle identification number (VIN) had been removed from the SUV.  No casualties were reported and no group immediately claimed responsibility.
